Due to the fluctuating restrictions, we saw an opportunity to join people together in those troublesome times by the common love of tea. Today, even though the pandemic is mostly behind us, our community moved forward with the times. We are hosting new activities every few weeks and hopefully when people come in they can feel welcomed and talk about anything over a cup of tea!"

It doesnâ€™t matter that if you like tea or not, as long as you like people who drink it, anyone can join in and have fun. We prioritize prioritizing the tea culture where people from all over the world can just sit down, enjoy the beverage, and have a great time with others."
